Map Generator:

The map is divided into sections, and terrain is created for 5 of them (each type of terrain can only be used once during the initial allocation).
Once 5 sections have their terrain assigned, the remaining sections take on the same type of terrain as their neighboring section. If neighboring sections have different types of terrain, one of them is randomly chosen.
This can be expanded upon or used as a component for a functional game similar to Civilization.
