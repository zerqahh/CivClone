Map generator:

The map is divided into sectors, and terrain is generated for 5 of them (each terrain type can only be used once during the initial allocation).
Once 5 sectors have terrain type, the remaining sectors adopt the same terrain type as their neighboring sector. In case where neighboring sectors have different terrain types, one of them is randomly assigned.
It can be expanded upon or used as a component for a functional Civilization-style game.
